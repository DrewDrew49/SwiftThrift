SwiftThrift
===========

eCommerce web application similar to craigslist but focused on usability of UI and UX


This project was a term project for my CSC 640 Software Engineering class at SFSU. 
The following technologies were used to build this project:

HTML/HTML5,
CSS/CSS3,
Bootstrap3,
JavaScript,
jQuery,
Amazon Web Services,
PHP(backend)

This project was geared toward ease of use and user experience. We wanted to take the best things that
craigslist/ebay/amazon had to offer and combine those features into one.
